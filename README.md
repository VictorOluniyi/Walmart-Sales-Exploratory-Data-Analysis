# Walmart-Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## About the project
This is a project that explores Walmart sales data to to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and the performance of different products and branches. The data can also be used to identify areas for improvement in the business, such as increasing customer satisfaction and optimizing sales strategies. The data used in this project comes from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting competition and includes historical sales data for 3 Walmart branches located in 3 different regions.

### Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to gain insights into Walmart sales data and understand the factors that affect sales. I performed the below analysis;
#### Customer analysis: to identify the most profitable customer segments, their purchasing behaviors and preferences. This information helped us tailor our marketing 
efforts and improve customer retention strategies, ultimately leading to increased sales.  
#### Product analysis: I conducted a thorough analysis of the product line, to identify the most profitable products and the ones that needed improvement. This information is needed to make better 
inventory and pricing decisions, and to focus our efforts on the products that would yield the best returns.
#### Sales analysis: By analyzing the sales data, I identified trends and patterns that allowed us to optimize our sales strategies. This can be used to adjust promotions and sales efforts to target high-potential customers and to increase our conversion rates.

## Approach
1. Data preparation: The data is loaded into PostgreSQL and cleaned and preprocessed as necessary. Missing values are imputed, and the data is transformed into a format suitable for analysis.
2. Exploratory data analysis: The data is explored using PostgreSQL to identify trends and patterns. Relationships between variables are analyzed to understand their impact on sales.
3. Conclusion: The findings from the analysis are summarized, and recommendations are made for optimizing Walmart's inventory management and pricing strategies.

## Results
The analysis of the Walmart sales data revealed several insights:

1. Sales tend to be higher during holiday periods and promotions.
2. Stores with larger sizes and higher temperatures tend to have higher sales.
3. Certain departments, such as electronics and toys, have higher sales during certain periods, such as Christmas.
4. The analysis of the Walmart sales data revealed several insights:

Sales tend to be higher during holiday periods and promotions.
Stores with larger sizes and higher temperatures tend to have higher sales.
Certain departments, such as electronics and toys, have higher sales during certain periods, such as Christmas.

## Conclusion    
This project shows how exploratory data analysis can be used to gain insights into Walmart sales data. The findings can be used to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and the performance of different products and branches. The data can also be used to identify areas for improvement in the business, such as increasing customer satisfaction and optimizing sales strategies. The project also demonstrates how SQL can be used to predict future sales based on historical data.
