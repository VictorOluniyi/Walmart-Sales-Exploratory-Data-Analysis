## Approach
1. Data preparation: The data is loaded into PostgreSQL and cleaned and preprocessed as necessary. Missing values are imputed, and the data is transformed into a format suitable for analysis.
2. Exploratory data analysis: The data is explored using PostgreSQL to identify trends and patterns. Relationships between variables are analyzed to understand their impact on sales.
3. Conclusion: The findings from the analysis are summarized, and recommendations are made for optimizing Walmart's inventory management and pricing strategies.

## Results
The analysis of the Walmart sales data revealed several insights:

1. Sales tend to be higher during holiday periods and promotions.
2. Stores with larger sizes and higher temperatures tend to have higher sales.
3. Certain departments, such as electronics and toys, have higher sales during certain periods, such as Christmas.
4. The analysis of the Walmart sales data revealed several insights:

Sales tend to be higher during holiday periods and promotions.
Stores with larger sizes and higher temperatures tend to have higher sales.
Certain departments, such as electronics and toys, have higher sales during certain periods, such as Christmas.

## Conclusion    
This project shows how exploratory data analysis can be used to gain insights into Walmart sales data. The findings can be used to optimize inventory management and pricing strategies, leading to increased profitability. The project also demonstrates how SQL can be used to predict future sales based on historical data.
